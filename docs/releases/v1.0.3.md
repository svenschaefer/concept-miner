# Release Notes: v1.0.3

Status: planned

## Scope

- Patch release for raw-text fallback extraction quality.

## Changes

- `src/core/fallback-extraction.js`:
  - added deterministic lexical filtering for fallback concept candidates.
  - excludes stopword-only/trivial terms from fallback concept output.
- `test/unit/concepts.contract.test.js`:
  - added explicit contract test for `"This is a test."` expecting only `test`.
  - added stopword-exclusion contract for `"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."`.

## Validation

- `npm run test:unit` passed.
- runtime extract integration contracts passed.
